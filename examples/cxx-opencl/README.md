## Craftr Example: C++ OpenCL/OpenGL

This example is derived from Intel's "OpenCL-OpenGL Interop" example which
can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl-support/code-samples).
It can only be compiled on Windows using MSVC (not MinGW) due to its reliance
on the Windows API and Windows resource files.
