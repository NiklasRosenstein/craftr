## Craftr Example: CUDA Mandelbrot Example

This example is derived from NVIDIA's Mandelbrot example from the CUDA 7.5 SDL.

__Building the Example__

You should be able to build the example with little configuration. On windows,
when you have MSVC 2017 installed, you need to specify a different MSVC version
as NVCC may not be compatible with it, eg. `--options msvc.version=120`.
