Craftr is a modular software build system written in Python that has native
support for C/C++, C#, Cython, Java and other languages. Craftr uses [Ninja]
as its build backbone.

### Current State

The core functionality is working and there is moderate support for C# and
Java, as well as some for C/C++, Haskell, OCaml and Vala &ndash; however the
interfaces for build scripts can change any time. The main goal at the moment
is to implement/improve support for the following languages:

* C/C++ (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
* Java (better Java 9 module support)

Some reference implementations are available in previous Craftr versions and
prototypes (namely [2.0], [v3.0.0-pre1] and [v3.0.0-pre2]).

  [2.0]: https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/tree/2.0
  [v3.0.0-pre1]: https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/tree/v3.0.0-pre1
  [v3.0.0-pre2]: https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/tree/v3.0.0-pre2
