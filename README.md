# The Craftr build system

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/craftr-build.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/craftr-build)

Craftr is a meta build system based on [Python 3] scripts which produces
[Ninja] build manifests. It enforces the use of modular build definitions
that can be re-used easily and ships with a standard library supporting
various programming languages and common libraries.

- [Craftr 2.x Wiki][Wiki]

__Features__

- [x] Aims to be cross-platform compatible (regularly tested on Windows, Mac OS and Linux)
- [x] Build definitions divided into versioned modules
- [x] Embedd actual Python functions into the build process (keyword Tasks)
- [x] Dependency-lock files for fully reproducible builds
- [ ] Package manager (hosted on [Craftr.net])

__Basic Usage__

    $ craftr version                            # Print Craftr version and exit
    $ craftr export                             # Generate Ninja manifest
    $ craftr build [target [target [...]]]      # Build all or the specified target(s)
    $ craftr clean [-r] [target [target [...]]] # Clean all or the specified target(s)
    $ craftr startpackage <name> [directory]    # Start a new Craftr project (manifest, Craftrfile)
    $ craftr lock                               # Generate a .dependency-lock file (after craftr export)

__C++ Example__

```python
cxx = load('craftr.lang.cxx')
program = cxx.executable(
  inputs = cxx.compile_cpp(sources = glob('src/**/*.cpp')),
  output = 'main'
)
```

__Java Example__

```python
java = load('craftr.lang.java')
jar = java.jar(
  inputs = java.compile(src_dir = local('src')),
  output = 'myapp',
  entry_point = 'Main'
)
```

__C# Example__

```python
cs = load('craftr.lang.csharp')
app = cs.compile(
  sources = glob('src/**/*.cs'),
  output = 'Main',
  target = 'exe'
)
```

__Cython Exmple__

```python
cython = load('craftr.lang.cython')
primes = cython.project(
  sources = [local('Primes.pyx')],
  main = local('Main.pyx')
)
run = runtarget(primes.main)
```

## How to Contribute

Please [create an Issue](https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/issues/new) if
you have any questions, problems or feature requests.

## Installation

Make sure you specify the specific version you want to install since there is
no untagged version of Craftr 2.x available on PyPI yet and otherwise Pip will
install Craftr 1.x (which is quite different). To get the newest stable version
of Craftr 2, use

    $ pip install craftr-build==2.0.0

To get the cutting edge development version, I suggest installing Craftr
from the Git repository into a virtualenv.

    $ virtualenv -p python3 env && source env/bin/activate
    $ git clone https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr.git -b development
    $ cd craftr
    $ pip install -e .
